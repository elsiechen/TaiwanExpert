# Distinctiveness and Complexity
## Distinctiveness
This project, TaiwanExpert, is a quiz website, which contains 1) limited time of shuffled questions user can take several times, 2) the reports of all quizzes user has done, and 3) the reward mechanism through quiz points. The main purpose of this project is to encourage people to know more about Taiwan culturally. 

Users will know some interesting facts of Taiwan through quiz just like they are on the quiz show. Users will receive result of quiz just after submitting all questions or when time's up. To reward users, users can exchange earned points for icons of Taiwan's renowned civilian food.

The features above make this project distinct from Pizza project(shopping cart), social network(Project 4), or e-commerce(Project 2).

## Complexity
Within each quiz, questions are shuffled and only one question is rendered in each page. Users are required to press "Next" button to proceed to the next question and "Finish" button if users reached the final one. If none option is selected and user press "Next" or "Finish" button, error message will show up and unable to proceed. 

Users are required to answer questions in limited time using timer. If users submit all questions in a quiz, report including earned points will be presented immediately though the time isn't up; if only one or more questions are submitted, report including earned points will be presented when time is up; if none question are answered and time is up, users will be informed error message, and there will not be report including points.

The history page will show all reports of quizzes. With "show details" button and "close details" button to show and hide detailed information using JavaScript fetch to retrieve details without reloading the page.

In the reward page, reward items are limited and every item can only be exchanged once. If items are exchanged with the required points, the items will be removed from the menu list and added to users' MyReward list. If users have not earned any points, error message will show up; if users have not exchanged any reward, there will be message about no exchanged reward yet. If users exchange points for reward item successfully, message will refer to the name of the item; if users failed to exchange points for reward, message will show lack of points and refer to the name of the item.

The project is done using localStorage to store each answered questions and JavaScript fetch to store quiz results. In each template, users interact with webpage (get report of quiz, press "Next" button, "show details" button, "close details" button, "exchange" button) using JavaScript without reloading the page.
